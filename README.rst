These directories are for different kinds of splash:

* light/dark: old style fbsplash (splashutils) theme
* grub: grub 2 background splash images
* kernel: kernel bootsplash, an alternative to fbsplash/plymouth

The upstream docs are fairly clear for the first two, the last one
is still a set of patches with a kernel source document and build
script for the firmware blob:

(current branches are 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16)
